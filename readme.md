# lstrip-on-steroids

In [another][engorge] late night discussion in the [#nwrug][] IRC room, [Ash Moran][AM] was after sane indent-aware multiline strings for his cucumber scenarios.

As of v0.9.5 you can use either Strings (`''`, `""`, `%{}`, etc) or HEREDOCs (`<<-EOF\nEOF`) with the leading `-` to have the shitespace stripped. *('Shitespace' was coined by Caius in [this tweet][shitespace].)*

## Installation

	$ sudo gem install lstrip-on-steroids

And then in your code:

	require "lstrip-on-steroids"

## Examples & Usage

Actually, I think my original scenario was RSpec :-) /Ash

For example, the following story reads ok, but you end up with extra shitespace at the start of each line:

	Scenario: Fake thing happens
	  When I do something
	  Then I should see %{
	    someone
	    did
	    something
	  }

The problem is, this gets an extra two spaces at the start of each line. You want it to be the string `"  someone\n  did\n  something"`, but you end up with `"\n    someone\n    did\n    something\n  "`.

The current solution is to delete the indent in the string:

	Scenario: Fake thing happens
	  When I do something
	  Then I should see %{
	someone
	did
	something
	}

But that just looks horrible, and you've amended your story to fit the code (kinda.)

Luckily, you can automatically work out just the right amount of whitespace you want to be removed from each line, so with a bit of jiggery pokery, you can have your cake and eat it too. (The cake is not a lie.)

Seeing as `String#-@` isn't defined already, this gem defines that for it, so you just prepend your multiline string with `-` to have it automagically strip the shitespace and leave the rest of your whitespace a-ok. So you end up with:

	Scenario: Fake thing happens
	  When I do something
	  Then I should see -%{
	    someone
	    did
	    something
	  }

which gives you back `"  someone\n  did\n  something"`, exactly what we want!
